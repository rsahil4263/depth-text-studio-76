# Preview Canvas Animation Fix

## Problem
The preview canvas was showing unwanted animations (pop/disappear/reappear) whenever users typed text or hovered over the canvas. This was disrupting the user experience and making the interface feel unstable.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. CSS Transitions on Canvas Elements
- **MobileImageEditor.module.css**: `transition: transform 0.3s ease;` on `.canvas`
- **HtmlImageEditor.module.css**: Multiple transitions including:
  - `transition: transform 0.2s ease-out;`
  - `transition: all 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);`

### 2. CSS Animations on Canvas Elements
- **HtmlImageEditor.module.css**: 
  - `animation: canvasAppear 0.6s ease-out forwards;` causing pop animation
  - `animation: canvasHoverGlow 0.5s ease-out;` on hover
  - Initial `opacity: 0` and `transform: scale(0.95)` causing disappear/reappear effect

### 3. JavaScript-Added Animation Classes
- **HtmlImageEditor.tsx**: Code that dynamically added animation classes:
  - `fadeInScale` class added to canvas on certain events
  - `microGlow` class added during text changes
  - `stateTransition` class applied to canvas element

### 4. Hardware Acceleration Properties
- `will-change: transform` on canvas causing unnecessary repaints during text updates

## Changes Made

### CSS Changes

#### MobileImageEditor.module.css
1. **Removed canvas transition**:
   ```css
   .canvas {
     max-width: 100%;
     max-height: 100%;
     border-radius: 8px;
     box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
     /* transition: transform 0.3s ease; - REMOVED */
   }
   ```

2. **Removed will-change from canvas**:
   ```css
   .canvas {
     /* Removed will-change to prevent unnecessary repaints during text updates */
   }
   ```

#### HtmlImageEditor.module.css
1. **Removed canvas transitions**:
   ```css
   .canvas {
     max-width: 100%;
     max-height: 100%;
     /* transition: transform 0.2s ease-out; - REMOVED */
     touch-action: none;
     user-select: none;
     -webkit-user-select: none;
   }
   ```

2. **Fixed canvas initial state**:
   ```css
   .canvas {
     border: 1px solid #333333;
     border-radius: 8px;
     box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
     image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
     image-rendering: crisp-edges;
     opacity: 1; /* Changed from 0 */
     transform: scale(1); /* Changed from scale(0.95) */
     /* animation: canvasAppear 0.6s ease-out forwards; - REMOVED */
     max-width: 100%;
     max-height: 100%;
     touch-action: pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom;
     user-select: none;
     -webkit-user-select: none;
   }
   ```

3. **Simplified hover effects**:
   ```css
   .canvas:hover {
     box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
     /* animation: canvasHoverGlow 0.5s ease-out; - REMOVED */
   }
   ```

4. **Removed animation classes**:
   ```css
   .fadeInScale {
     /* Animation removed to prevent canvas pop effects */
   }
   
   .stateTransition {
     /* Transition removed to prevent canvas animations during text updates */
   }
   
   .microGlow {
     /* Animation removed to prevent canvas glow effects during text changes */
   }
   ```

5. **Removed animation keyframes**:
   - `@keyframes canvasHoverGlow` - removed
   - `@keyframes canvasAppear` - removed
   - `@keyframes fadeInScale` - removed
   - `@keyframes microGlow` - removed

### JavaScript Changes

#### HtmlImageEditor.tsx
1. **Removed celebration animation**:
   ```typescript
   // Canvas animation removed to prevent unwanted pop effects
   ```

2. **Removed micro-animation on text changes**:
   ```typescript
   // Canvas micro-animation removed to prevent unwanted glow effects during text changes
   ```

3. **Removed stateTransition class from canvas**:
   ```typescript
   className={`${styles.canvas} ${isPinching ? 'pinching' : ''} ${isTouchPanning ? 'panning' : ''}`}
   ```

4. **Removed fadeInScale class from canvas container**:
   ```typescript
   <div className={styles.canvasContainer}>
   ```

## Result
- ✅ No more pop animations when users type
- ✅ No more disappear/reappear effects on hover
- ✅ Stable preview canvas that doesn't animate during text updates
- ✅ Maintained all functional interactions (zoom, pan, etc.)
- ✅ Preserved visual styling without disruptive animations

## Testing
The changes have been applied and the development server is running on http://localhost:8082/. Users can now type text and interact with the canvas without experiencing unwanted animations.
