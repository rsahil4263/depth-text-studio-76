# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves replacing the current client-side background removal implementation that uses Hugging Face transformers.js with the @imgly/background-removal library. The goal is to significantly improve processing speed, accuracy, and user experience while maintaining the existing "text behind image" functionality. The new implementation will provide faster, more efficient background removal processing directly in the browser via WebAssembly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload my image and have the background removed quickly and automatically, so I can start adding and styling my text without a long wait.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL process the background removal in less than 4 seconds on a standard broadband connection
2. WHEN the background removal process starts THEN the system SHALL display a clear loading indicator over the image area
3. WHEN the background removal completes THEN the system SHALL immediately display the processed image with transparent background
4. WHEN the processing is complete THEN the system SHALL allow the user to proceed with text editing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I expect the subject of my photo to be accurately identified and separated from the background, even for moderately complex images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve the quality of the subject cutout compared to the current transformers.js implementation
2. WHEN processing images with complex backgrounds THEN the system SHALL accurately separate the foreground subject
3. WHEN processing images with fine details like hair THEN the system SHALL preserve edge quality as much as possible
4. WHEN the processed image is displayed THEN the system SHALL correctly layer the original image, text, and foreground-only image to achieve the "text behind" effect

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on a mobile device, I want the background removal process to complete without crashing my browser or draining my battery excessively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing images on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL complete without browser crashes
2. WHEN processing on resource-constrained devices THEN the system SHALL use efficient WebAssembly implementation
3. WHEN processing large images THEN the system SHALL handle them without excessive memory usage
4. WHEN processing fails due to device limitations THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, if the background removal process fails for any reason, I want to see a clear and helpful error message so I know what to do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the background removal process fails THEN the system SHALL catch the error and stop the loading indicator
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error toast with message "Could not process image. Please try another one."
3. WHEN an error is displayed THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry with a different image
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL maintain error rate below 1%

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the old transformers.js implementation completely, so that the codebase is simplified and bundle size is reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new implementation is complete THEN the system SHALL have all transformers.js background removal code removed
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the transformers.js package SHALL be removed from package.json
3. WHEN cleanup is done THEN all related model files SHALL be deleted from the project
4. WHEN the new service is implemented THEN it SHALL accept image sources (File, Blob, or imageUrl) and return image Blob with transparent background

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to work with proper CORS headers, so that the @imgly/background-removal library functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL have Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy set to "same-origin"
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL have Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy set to "require-corp"
3. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL handle cross-origin requirements properly
4. WHEN the library is integrated THEN it SHALL function correctly across supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
