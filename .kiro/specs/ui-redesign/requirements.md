# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves redesigning the entire user interface of the text-behind-image application using a provided HTML/CSS/JavaScript as  referance and do it in react implementation. The goal is to replace the current old React-based UI with a modern, Perplexity-style interface that maintains all existing functionality while providing a significantly improved user experience with better visual design, smoother interactions, and enhanced usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern, visually appealing interface that feels professional and polished, so that I enjoy using the application and feel confident in its capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display the new Perplexity-style dark theme interface
2. WHEN the interface is rendered THEN the system SHALL use the exact color scheme from the provided HTML (background #1F2121, sidebar #191919, accent #20B2AA)
3. WHEN elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the SF Pro Display font family as the primary typeface
4. WHEN the layout is shown THEN the system SHALL maintain the two-column layout with left sidebar (340px) and main content area

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all the text editing controls organized in a clean sidebar, so that I can easily find and adjust text properties without cluttering the main workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar loads THEN the system SHALL display organized sections for "Text Settings" and "Position & Effects"
2. WHEN text controls are shown THEN the system SHALL include text content input, font family selector, font size slider, style toggles (bold/italic/underline), and color picker
3. WHEN position controls are displayed THEN the system SHALL include horizontal position, vertical position, opacity, and depth blur sliders
4. WHEN sliders are used THEN the system SHALL show real-time value indicators and smooth visual feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the main canvas area to provide an immersive editing experience with zoom and pan capabilities, so that I can work precisely with my images and text positioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main content area loads THEN the system SHALL display a centered viewport with dark background and subtle border styling
2. WHEN an image is loaded THEN the system SHALL support Ctrl+scroll zoom functionality from 10% to 500%
3. WHEN zoomed in THEN the system SHALL allow click-and-drag panning to navigate around the image
4. WHEN zoom or pan is active THEN the system SHALL display zoom level indicator and provide zoom control buttons

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth drag-and-drop image upload with clear visual feedback, so that adding images to my project feels intuitive and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no image is loaded THEN the system SHALL display an attractive upload area with icon, instructions, and hover effects
2. WHEN dragging files over the upload area THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with color changes and scaling animation
3. WHEN dropping an image THEN the system SHALL immediately process and display the image with fade-in animation
4. WHEN upload is complete THEN the system SHALL hide the upload area and show the image with proper aspect ratio fitting
5. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL generate the same high-quality output as the current implementation
6. WHEN user is uploading the image it will show the status so they can now the process is happening 

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to work exactly the same as before, so that the redesign enhances rather than disrupts my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is entered THEN the system SHALL maintain the text-behind-image effect with proper layering
2. WHEN background removal is triggered THEN the system SHALL use the existing AI processing pipeline
3. WHEN exporting images THEN the system SHALL generate the same high-quality output as the current implementation
4. WHEN using all controls THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing text styling, positioning, and effect capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features to work properly, so that I can use the application efficiently and it remains accessible to all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL support Ctrl+B (bold), Ctrl+I (italic), Ctrl+U (underline), Ctrl+S (export), Ctrl+O (upload)
2. WHEN using zoom shortcuts THEN the system SHALL support Ctrl+0 (reset), Ctrl+= (zoom in), Ctrl+- (zoom out)
3. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus states with the accent color outline
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL maintain proper accessibility attributes and labels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to provide helpful status indicators and smooth animations, so that I always understand what's happening and the experience feels polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN actions are performed THEN the system SHALL display temporary status indicators (Ready, Text updated, Image loaded, etc.)
2. WHEN elements appear THEN the system SHALL use fade-in animations and smooth transitions
3. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide subtle hover effects and micro-animations
4. WHEN processing occurs THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new UI to integrate seamlessly with the existing React application architecture, so that all current services and functionality continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new UI is implemented THEN the system SHALL wrap the HTML/CSS/JavaScript in a React component
2. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL properly initialize all event listeners and functionality
3. WHEN integrating with existing services THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with background removal, image processing, and export services
4. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN the system SHALL require no changes to existing backend services or API endpoints
