- Slightly smaller padding
- Maintained horizontal layout

**Tablet Portrait (768px - 1023px):**
- Sidebar stacks on top (40vh max-height)
- Horizontal scrolling for sidebar sections
- Sidebar toggle button added

- Toggle button appears on mobile/tablet
- Smooth CSS transitions for show/hide
- Proper ARIA labels for accessibility

**Toggle Functionality:**
- `toggleSidebar()` function with state management
- Visual feedback with status messages
- Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space)
- Proper focus management

**Responsive Sidebar Features:**
- Horizontal scrolling on tablet for sections
- Reduced heights on mobile (40vh â†’ 35vh â†’ 30vh)
- Touch-optimized controls
- Proper z-index management

#### 4. Tablet and Mobile Device Optimization

**Tablet Specific (768px - 1023px):**
- Landscape: Maintains horizontal layout
- Portrait: Stacks vertically with collapsible sidebar
- Medium-sized touch targets (48px)

- Larger touch targets (48-52px)
- Optimized viewport usage
- Gesture-based interactions

**Cross-Device Features:**
- Responsive breakpoint detection
