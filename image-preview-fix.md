# Image Preview Fix - Mobile Canvas Not Showing

## Problem Identified
After the fallback processing completed successfully at 95%, the image was not showing in the mobile preview area. The processing was working (fallback mask was created), but the canvas was not being rendered.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Canvas Rendering Logic**: The `renderCanvas` function existed but wasn't being called reliably after processing
2. **State Updates**: The `processedCanvas` and `imageMask` were being set, but the canvas wasn't updating
3. **useEffect Dependencies**: The canvas rendering useEffect wasn't triggering properly
4. **Animation Frame Issues**: Mobile animation manager might have been interfering with canvas updates

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Comprehensive Debugging
- **Console Logging**: Added detailed logs to track canvas rendering process
- **State Tracking**: Log when processedCanvas and imageMask are set
- **Render Tracking**: Log each step of the canvas rendering process
- **Error Handling**: Better error logging for canvas operations

### 2. Improved Canvas Rendering Logic
- **Fallback Rendering**: Always try to draw the processed image, even if text rendering fails
- **Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback levels for canvas rendering
- **State Validation**: Check all required states before rendering
- **Manual Triggers**: Force canvas render after processing completes

### 3. Fixed useEffect Dependencies
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Removed complex animation manager dependency
- **Direct Rendering**: Use setTimeout instead of requestAnimationFrame for reliability
- **State-Based Triggers**: Trigger on processedCanvas, imageMask, and currentImage changes
- **Immediate Updates**: Reduced delay for faster visual feedback

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Wrap all canvas operations in error handling
- **Fallback Rendering**: If text-behind-subject fails, show just the processed image
- **State Recovery**: Don't crash if one part of rendering fails

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/components/MobileImageEditor.tsx`**:
   - Added comprehensive logging to `renderCanvas` function
   - Added manual canvas render trigger after processing
   - Simplified useEffect for canvas rendering
   - Enhanced error handling with multiple fallback levels
   - Added state validation before rendering

### Key Improvements:
- **Reliability**: Canvas will always try to show something, even if processing partially fails
- **Debugging**: Detailed console logs help identify issues
- **Performance**: Simplified rendering logic reduces complexity
- **User Experience**: Image appears immediately after processing

## Expected Behavior Now

### Success Case:
1. Image uploads and processes successfully
2. Canvas renders with processed image
3. Text-behind-subject effect works
4. User sees the result immediately

### Fallback Case:
1. AI processing times out
2. Fallback mask is created
3. Canvas renders with fallback processing
4. User sees the image with basic subject detection
5. Text-behind-subject works with fallback mask

### Error Case:
1. If text rendering fails, show just the processed image
2. If everything fails, show error message but keep UI functional
3. Console logs help identify the specific issue

## Debugging Information
The console will now show:
- When renderCanvas is called and why
- Canvas and processed canvas dimensions
- Whether mask and image data are available
- Each step of the rendering process
- Any errors that occur during rendering

## Testing
With the development server running on `http://localhost:8081/`, test:
1. Upload an image on mobile
2. Check browser console for detailed logs
3. Verify image appears in preview after processing
4. Test text-behind-subject functionality
5. Try different image sizes and formats

The mobile version should now reliably show the processed image in the preview area, with detailed console logging to help identify any remaining issues.
